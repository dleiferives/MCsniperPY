## An easy to use, fast, and async name sniper written in python.

## IMPORTANT

If you decide to use any code from this project your project **must** be open source. Also, if you if you modify this I would appreciate the changes being documented and the source code shared on GitHub.

## Usage

- Join my [discord](https://discord.gg/pFQQwNkuc3) server for the instructions on usage.
- Also, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperPY/wiki) for usage steps. **The wiki is still under construction and may be fragmented / not contain all the necessary info.**
- **[config file usage](https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperPY/wiki/config)**

## Linux easy installation

Run `bash -c "curl -sLo mcsniperpy.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MCsniperPY/MCsniperPY/master/install.sh && chmod +x mcsniperpy.sh && ./mcsniperpy.sh"` in your terminal to install the sniper. To run it again just type `./mcsniperpy.sh`. 


## ⚠ warnings ⚠
- Use this at your own risk. This *can* get your account permanantly locked by mojang. It is very rare and won't happen if you know what you're doing.
- If your accounts have security questions you cannot use more than 3 per IP address. This makes getting names very difficult so please avoid using accounts with security questions.
- **DO NOT USE A CUSTOM DELAY OF BELOW 40 IN MOST CASES. Refer to the [FAQ page](https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperPY/wiki/FAQ) on the wiki for info on custom delay.**
- Please don't come into the discord and ask people for delays. You'll have to learn them for yourself.

## More info

If you find any bugs please report them in my discord. There are still many which we are still finding and removing. Also, please refer to the wiki for the config file!

If you're looking to develop a sniper [this](https://github.com/AlvinoNguyen/MCsniperPY) branch of the sniper has much cleaner code though it is slightly outdated. ⚠ DOESN'T WORK WITH NEW API ⚠
